# 📩 Spam Message Prediction using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Spam Message Classifier** using **Deep Learning** techniques. The model analyzes text messages and classifies them as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. It is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and utilizes word embeddings to extract meaningful features from text data.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🔍 **Classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam).**  
- 🤖 **Uses NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.**  
- 📊 **Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.**  
- 🔄 **Implements deep learning techniques for robust classification.**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages:  
- **Spam messages:** Unwanted promotional or phishing messages.  
- **Ham messages:** Normal, non-spam messages.  

Preprocessing includes:  
- **Lowercasing & tokenization.**  
- **Removing special characters & stopwords.**  
- **Applying TF-IDF or word embeddings for text representation.**  

## 🛠 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
```bash  
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn nltk  
```  

## 🏗 Model Architecture  
- **Neural Network-based Text Classification Model**  
- **Embedding Layer:** Converts words into dense vector representations.  
- **LSTM/GRU Layers:** Captures sequential relationships in text.  
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Extracts features for final classification.  
- **Activation Function:** Softmax for binary classification.  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy.  
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for better performance.  

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process  
1. 📥 **Load & preprocess the dataset.**  
2. 🔤 **Apply NLP techniques for text cleaning and vectorization.**  
3. 🏗 **Build and train the deep learning model.**  
4. 🎯 **Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.**  
5. 📊 **Visualize model predictions and error analysis.**  

## 📊 Project Insights & Results  
### 🔍 Insights:  
- **Common spam keywords:** Free, win, claim, offer, urgent, lottery, etc.  
- **Text length variation:** Spam messages are generally longer and contain more special characters.  
- **Misclassification patterns:** Some legitimate promotional messages are falsely classified as spam.  

### 📈 Results:  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~98%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~96%  
- **Precision & Recall:** High values, indicating effective spam detection.  
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** Minimal false positives and false negatives.  

## 🚀 Usage  
To run the model, execute the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash  
jupyter notebook spam_predictor.ipynb  
```  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- 🏆 **Improve model performance using Transformer models like BERT.**  
- 📡 **Deploy the model as a web API for real-time spam detection.**  
- 📈 **Analyze linguistic trends in spam messages over time.**
